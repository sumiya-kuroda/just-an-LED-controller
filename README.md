## Part list
- [Gang rocker switch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CPXW2M9P?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title): Any switch should work in theory. We use this switch because it comes with an enclosure. This enclosure is quite small, so consider 3D-printing an enclosure extension, which you can find under `cad/`
- Arduino Uno (Upload `ledcontroller/ledcontroller.ino`)
- BNC terminal x3
- BNC splitter x3
- [Relay](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09M62VCGX?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1) x3
- 3.5 mm jack terminal x1 (to provide 12VDC for LEDs)
